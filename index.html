            field of Cloud computing and engineering. I have always been keen to learn how the cloud works and how its services can help businesses run efficiently. 
            I have listed some of my skills and projects in this portfolio and appreciate the time you spend going through them. Currently, I am trying to come up with an
            app with Amazon Sagemaker and Lex. I am still working on it and it will be updated as soon as a prototype is done. Again, thank you for 
            taking the time to go through my portfolio and please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.</div>
